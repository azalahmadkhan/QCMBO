# QCMBO
A new metaheuristic optimization algorithm which can be used to solve various optimization functions and provide a suitable solution which is equal or near to global minima in case of minimization problem.

QCMBO was developed with a motivation to make new optimization algorithm with faster convergence.

Currently, we provide the p code of the algorithm, which can be accessed using the following link - https://github.com/azalahmadkhan/QCMBO/tree/main/Codes/OpimizationAlgorithms/QCMBO
